talkiepi is a headless capable Mumble client written in Go, written for walkie talkie style use on the Pi using GPIO pins for push to talk and LED status.  It is a fork of [barnard](https://github.com/layeh/barnard), which was a great jump off point for me to learn golang and have something that worked relatively quickly.


## 3D printable enclosure

In the stl directory are the stl files for the enclosure I have designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi B+ board layout (I am using a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B) and the PCB and components from the [US Robotics USB Speakerphone](https://www.amazon.com/USRobotics-USB-Internet-Speakerphone-USR9610/dp/B000E6IL10/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472691020&sr=8-1&keywords=us+robotics+speakerphone).
I will be posting a blog post shortly with a full component list and build guide.  For more information regarding building a full talkiepi device, go check out my blog at [projectable.me](http://projectable.me).


## Installing talkiepi

I have put together an install guide [here](doc/README.md).


## GPIO

You can edit your pin assignments in `talkiepi.go`
```go
const (
	OnlineLEDPin        uint = 18
	ParticipantsLEDPin  uint = 23
	TransmitLEDPin      uint = 24
	TransmitButtonPin   uint = 25
)
```

Here is a basic schematic of how I am currently controlling the LEDs and pushbutton:
